Whatever I get will be a good upgrade for me obviously, but there’s little time left to 17 and I am not sure if I understand the extent of these upgrades (and the others, for that matter) that well, so I’d appreciate if more tech savvy and Apple guru users can help me decide if I’m being too hasty.

(It’s like 400$ payed in 24 months) or better to wait till the new one releases before financing so it’s maybe cheaper? For all you iPhone connoisseur lmk...\n",
