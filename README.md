#  Reddit Comment Sentiment Analyzer

This project is a simple yet powerful tool that performs **sentiment analysis** on Reddit post comments using **VADER** (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) from the `nltk` library, and **PRAW** (Python Reddit API Wrapper) for accessing Reddit data.

It's useful for analyzing community sentiment around hot topics in any subreddit — whether it's news, tech, gaming, finance, or general discussions.
